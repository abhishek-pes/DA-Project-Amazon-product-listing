## Problem Significance
  1. The problem statement we are trying to solve is to create a multi-class classifier model , which will help to classify products based on the product description given. This is intended to improve the overall search and user experience while searching for any product on an ecommerce website like Amazon.
  
  2. Since the proposed solution is focussing on the NLP techniques , this can also be further extended to voice based assistants , where users just tell the product description they are looking for and they will be landed to the right category of product they were looking for.
